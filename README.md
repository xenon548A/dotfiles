# DOTFILES GRUVBOX THEME

These are my dotfiles for the gruvbox rice i did long ago, a minimal and clean UI.

- There is a bash script /i3/scripts/i3bartoggle.sh, i implemented it long ago, it hides your i3 bar on pressing (ALT+H)
- The Super/MOD key in my config is alt, not windows, so be careful of that while implementing
- I never intended to provide them publicaly, but now i am doing so, that is why there is a lack of comments, to change any behaviour, you can refer to respective documentation
of i3, rofi, alacritty and neofetch.
- Alacritty has migrated to `.toml` from `.yml`, while using this alacritty config, you will get warning that alacritty has migrated,
just input ```alacritty migrate``` in alacritty terminal, and you will be good to go.
